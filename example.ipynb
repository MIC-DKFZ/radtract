    "### Tract preprocessing/filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "While the above commands already yield smooth tracts between the segmented start- and end-regions, in some cases it is necessary to further process and filter the resulting tracts to remove outliers, to remove prematurely ending streamlines, etc. RadTract provides the following commands to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `radtract_filter_curvature`: Remove streamlines with a high curvature over a certain distance.\n",
    "2. `radtract_filter_length`: Remove short or long streamlines.\n",
    "3. `radtract_filter_density`: Remove streamlines with a certain fraction of streamline points located in sparsely populated tract regions, which are likely outliers.\n",
    "4. `radtract_filter_visitationcount`: Same as above, but using the visitation count instead of the density, i.e. the accumulated length of all streamline segments in a voxel.\n",
    "5. `radtract_filter_maskoverlap`: Remove streamlines with a certain fraction of streamline points located outside of the provided mask.\n",
    "6. `radtract_filter_endpoints`: Enables various endpoint filtering methods, e.g. keep stremlines with exactly one endpoint in provided mask or with two endpoints located in different label regions etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 and 4 can either be used with precalculated density/visitation count maps or with a dummy image as refernce, that is used for calculating the maps internally."

    "### Parcellation\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, it is very important to keep the number of parcels and the orientation of tracts constant when parcellating tracts for multiple subjects. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The number of parcels\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix the number of parcels when running `radtract_parcellate`, this parameter can be explicitely specified using `--num_parcels`. In this case the number of parcels is not estimated automatically per tract and subject, but the provided number is used. To obtain a suitable value for this parameter, the command `radtract_estimate_num_parcels` on a set of tracts, e.g. the left CST of all your subjects. The command will ouput a CSV file with the estimated number of parcels for this tract for each subject. For parcellating your tracts, the median or rounded mean of these values is probably a good choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unify orientation of tracts across subjects\n",
    "\n",
    "Tractograms do not contain information about where a tract starts and where it ends. For example in case of the CST, the start of the tract could be near the cortex or near the spine, and if this changes between subjects, the labels of the parcellation will be reversed and no menaingful analysis can be performed. To avoid this, you can pass an ROI image to RadTract that defines where the tract starts, using `--start`. Start regions can be segmented manually or calculated automaticall, e.g., using TractSeg.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parcellation types\n",
    "\n",
    "RadTract offers multiple types (`--type`) of parcellations, namely hyperplane (default), centerline and static. Furthermore, the parcellation can happen in voxel-space (default, required for radiomics analysis) or in streamline-space (classic tractometry, option `--streamline_space`). In the figure below, the different types of parcellations are illustrated. In the next cell you will find the corresponding commands used to create these results.\n",
